## Use Bard to Make Training More Entertaining

Documentation and training! It can be boring and yet highly necessary. What if you need to do a presentation on some dry technical material? How do you prevent people from nodding off during your turn at "Lunch and Learn"? Comedy and humor can be hard to execute well, especially in an office environment. Well, we can have Bard assist with this! 

Let's say you need to train your employees on allowing unsigned apps on their Macbooks. There is a security feature in macOS that prevents installing apps outside the Apple-approved app store. However, developers will often find themselves needing to install tools that are not verified by Apple. Let's first ask Bard how to disable this feature so we know what to present.

**PROMPT:**

```
How do I allow an unsigned app in macOS? 
```

**RESPONSE:**

```
There are two ways to allow an unsigned app in macOS:

By overriding your security settings:

In the Finder on your Mac, locate the app you want to open. Don't use Launchpad to do this.
Control-click the app icon, then choose Open from the shortcut menu.
Click Open.
By changing your security settings:

Open System Preferences by clicking the Apple icon in the top-left corner of your screen and choosing System Preferences.
Click Security & Privacy.
Click General.
Click the lock icon in the bottom-left corner and enter your password.
Select Allow apps downloaded from: Anywhere.

Note: Allowing apps from anywhere can increase your risk of malware infections. Only allow apps from sources you trust.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind when allowing unsigned apps in macOS:

Unsigned apps are not reviewed by Apple for security or compatibility.
Unsigned apps may contain malware or other malicious software.
Unsigned apps may not work properly or may crash your Mac.
If you are unsure whether an app is safe to open, it is best to err on the side of caution and not open it.
```

Alright, that's all good. We will want to verify this information by going to Apple's documentation. Next, if we want to package this information for a training session, maybe we can make it a bit more entertaining and memorable. What better way to do that than write in the style of a daytime TV "has this happened to you?" infomercial from the early 2000's? Let's give it a shot. 


**PROMPT:**

```
Okay rewrite that but in the style of a "has this happened to you?" infomercial
```

**RESPONSE:**

```
Have you ever tried to open an app on your Mac, only to be met with a warning that it's from an unidentified developer?

Are you tired of being restricted to only opening apps from the Mac App Store?

Do you want to be able to open any app you want, regardless of where it came from?

If so, then you need to allow unsigned apps on your Mac!

Allowing unsigned apps gives you the freedom to open any app you want, without being restricted by the Mac App Store.

But be careful! Allowing unsigned apps can also increase your risk of malware infection.

That's why it's important to only allow unsigned apps from trusted sources.

If you're not sure whether an app is safe, it's best to avoid it.

But if you're looking for the freedom to open any app you want, then you need to allow unsigned apps on your Mac!

So what are you waiting for?

```

This is pretty good, but I suspect Bard is showing a little bit of restraint. Let's see if we can prompt it to be a little more bombastic which is often the style of these infomercials. 

**PROMPT:**

```
Can you make it more bombastic and over-the-top?
```

**RESPONSE:**

```

Sure, here is the text in a more bombastic and over-the-top style:

Are you tired of being limited by the Mac App Store?

Do you want to open any app you want, regardless of where it came from?

Do you want to be free to explore the cutting-edge of software development?

If so, then you need to allow unsigned apps on your Mac!

Allowing unsigned apps is like taking the training wheels off your Mac. It gives you the freedom to do whatever you want, without being restricted by the Mac App Store.

But be careful! Allowing unsigned apps can also increase your risk of malware infection.

That's why it's important to only allow unsigned apps from trusted sources.

If you're not sure whether an app is safe, it's best to avoid it.

But if you're looking for the freedom to explore the cutting-edge of software development, then you need to allow unsigned apps on your Mac!

So what are you waiting for?

Change your security settings today and start exploring the world of unsigned apps!

But wait, there's more!

Okay this is great! The free copy of "How to Stay Safe with Unsigned Apps" is a nice touch not just for comedic purposes, but it emphasizes the safety responsibility aspect too.  Something is missing though... oh yeah! We need a customer testimonial that typically backs the infomercial's claims. 

**PROMPT:**

```
Add a customer testimonial too 
```

**RESPONSE:**

```
Sure, here is a customer testimonial:

"I used to be so frustrated with the Mac App Store. I couldn't find the apps I wanted, and the ones I did find were often outdated. But then I learned about how to allow unsigned apps on my Mac, and my life changed! I can now open any app I want, regardless of where it came from. I've found some amazing apps that I never would have found in the Mac App Store. And I haven't had any problems with malware or security. If you're looking for the freedom to use any app you want, then you need to allow unsigned apps on your Mac! It's the best thing I ever did."

- John Smith, Software Developer

I hope this helps!

Okay, now our training session on unsigned apps is going to be a hit thanks to the assistance of Bard. Have some slides with royal blue backgrounds, flashing yellow text, a "1-800" number, and we are set. Next time, when we are asked to do a cybersecurity seminar, we can do it in the style of the Shamwow guy.

Lastly, here is a productivity tip. Do not be afraid of some manual editing rather than coaxing the perfect and complete script from Bard. You can cherry-pick, mix, and match outputs. The infomercial scripts did not exactly explain the steps to allow unsigned apps.  However, we can insert those steps into the script with a simple copy/paste. Editing and cobbling together outputs is perfectly okay!
