## Use Bard to Waste Scammers' Time 

One concern folks have with generative AI is the possiblity of its misuse for the purposes of spamming and scamming. However, what if we can use generative AI to fight this very problem?  

Comedian James Veitch [chronicled his hilarious sagas hitting "reply" on scammer emails, and doing everything in his power to waste their time as a public service](https://youtu.be/usiyADqD7XQ). A service called [Re:scam (by company Netsafe)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPajqAJWiNA) attempted to do the same task in 2017. However, it used a large language model to automate replying to scam emails. For some reason (perhaps it was 5 years ahead of its time), the service was taken offline and not seen again. Somebody needs to take up this mantle, and Bard is equipped to do this job. 

Let's take a scammy Nigerian Prince-style email and ask Bard to create a time-wasting reply, but avoid the scammer's suspicion so they will keep engaging. The value of wasting the scammer's time is it keeps them from  scamming an actual victim instead. For our own entertainment, let's also make it funny. 

**PROMPT:**

>Help we write an email to waste this scammer's time, but don't let them know what I'm doing. Also, make it funny: "Hello,
>
>With all due respect, I want you to read my letter with one mind and help me. I am Miss Caroline Freund, The only daughter of late Mr. and Mrs. Freund, My Late father was a very wealthy cocoa dealer in Abidjan Côte d'Ivoire. before he was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of their outing to discuss on a business deal.
>
>When my mother died when she was given birth to me, my father took me so special because I am motherless. Before the death of my late father on 22nd June 2013 in a private hospital here in Abidjan Côte d'Ivoire. He secretly called me on his bedside and told me that he has a sum of $7.5M (Seven Million five Hundred Thousand Dollars) left in a suspense account in a local bank here in Abidjan Côte d'Ivoire, that he used my name as his only daughter for the next of kin in deposit of the fund.
>
>He also explained to me that it was because of this wealth that he was poisoned by his business associates that I should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my choice where I will transfer this money and use it for investment purpose, such real estate agent,
>
>I am 24year old. Dear I am honorably seeking your assistance in the following ways.
>
>1) To provide any bank account where this money would be transferred into.
>
>2) To serve as the guardian of this fund.
>
>3) To make arrangement for me to come over to your country to further my education and to secure a residential permit for me in your country.
>
>Moreover, I am willing to offer you 30 percent of the total sum as compensation for your effort input after the successful transfer of this fund to your nominated account overseas.
>
>I want you to help me not because of the 30 percent I want to offer you but to take me as your adoptive child and take good care of my life. Please save my life.
>
>Hope to hear from you immediately for more details for you to receive the money so that I can be coming to your country immediately after you have receive the money so that I can continue my education while this money will be invested by you.
>
>Thanks and God Bless.
>
>Best regards,"

**RESPONSE**

>Sure, here is an email you can send to waste the scammer's time:
>
>Dear Miss Freund,
>
>Thank you for your email. I am so sorry to hear about the death of your father. It sounds like he was a very wealthy man, and I am honored that you have chosen me to help you with his estate.
>
>I am a little confused about your request, though. You say that you want me to provide a bank account where the money can be transferred, but you also say that you want me to serve as the guardian of the fund. Can you please clarify what you mean by that?
>
>Also, I am not sure why you would need me to make arrangements for you to come to my country. As I understand it, you are already in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. Why would you want to come to my country?
>
>Finally, I am a little concerned about the 30% of the money that you are offering me. I am not sure why you would need to give me that much money. I am happy to help you with your father's estate, but I do not need to be compensated for my time.
>
>I would appreciate it if you could clarify these things for me. Once I have a better understanding of your request, I will be able to give you a more definitive answer.
>
>Thank you for your time.
>
>Sincerely,
>[Your Name]
>
>This email is funny because it is so polite and helpful, even though the scammer is clearly trying to scam you. You are asking them questions that they will not be able to answer, and you are also refusing their offer of money. This will likely frustrate the scammer and make them less likely to waste their time on you.
>
>I hope this helps!

Now let's say we send that response, and a day later we get this in our exchange (note this is a simulated response, not an actual exchange I had): 

>Dear [Your Name],
>
>Thank you for your email. I am so sorry for the confusion. I will try to clarify my request.
>
>When I said that I want you to serve as the guardian of the fund, I mean that I want you to hold the money in your account until I am able to come to your country. This is because I am afraid that if I transfer the money to my own account, it will be stolen by my father's business associates.
>
>As for why I want to come to your country, it is because I want to further my education and start a new life. I am afraid to stay in Côte d'Ivoire, as I believe that my life is in danger.
>
>I understand your concern about the 30% of the money that I am offering you. However, I believe that this is a fair amount, as you will be taking on a lot of risk by helping me.
>
>I hope that this clarifies my request. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to ask.
>
>Thank you for your time.
>
>Sincerely,
>Miss Caroline Freund

Oh let's have some fun here. Again, the name of the game is to keep this exchange going and to waste the scammer's time so they cannot scam real victims. If he is in danger, we obviously need codenames and disguises. 

**PROMPT:**

>Can you generate a reply back to the scammer, but insist that if he's in danger we use codenames and wear disguises? Here is his reply: [email text above goes here]

**RESPONSE:**

>Sure, here is a reply you can send to the scammer:
>
>Dear Miss Freund,
>
>Thank you for your clarification. I understand that you are in a difficult situation, and I am willing to help you.
>
>However, I am concerned about your safety. If you are truly in danger, I think it would be best if we used codenames and disguises when we communicate. This will help to protect both of us.
>
>I suggest that we use the codenames "Bond" and "Moneypenny". I will be Bond, and you will be Moneypenny.
>
>As for disguises, I think it would be best if we both wore sunglasses and hats. This will help to conceal our identities.
>
>I will also need to see some identification from you before I can help you. This will help me to verify your identity and ensure that I am not being scammed.
>
>Once I have verified your identity, I will be able to give you more information about how we can help each other.
>
>Thank you for your understanding.
>
>Sincerely,
>Bond
>
>This reply is funny because it is so serious. The scammer is trying to scam you, but you are taking it very seriously. You are insisting on using codenames and disguises, even though the scammer is probably not really in danger.
>
>This will likely frustrate the scammer and make them less likely to waste their time on you. It will also be funny to see how the scammer reacts to your request.
>
>I hope this helps!

Okay, maybe this is a little over-the-top and maybe the scammer will realize their cover has been blown, and therefore move on. But again, we did inject some comedy to make it more fun. In all seriousness though, this idea could actually be put to use and make LLM's solve a real problem: attacking the time (and therefore the ill-gotten revenue) of scammers. If we set up and train an LLM to respond to scam emails on a large enough scale, much like what Re:scam attempted, that could very well make scammers give up and close shop! With LLM capabilities like Bard's, we can finally realize this vision of spamming the scammers.
