## Use Bard to Write Fan Fiction, Spinoffs, and Sequels

When I started to use LLM's like Bard, some of the most fun I had was having it do "fan fiction." I have to call it that because I do not have any influence on my favorite characters in TV shows, movies, books, etc. But it was still fun to throw different plot ideas at these characters and see what Bard would generate. For example, Bard can create crossovers with different characters from different franchises, or create spinoffs and sequels. This certainly inspired some creativity and made me wish I worked in show business. 

The key though is, like any task, is to provide a prompt with specific guidance to do something original and interesting... rather than giving a generic prompt that will produce generic results. For example, if I ask it "Write another episode of the TV show Frasier," I am probably going to get predictable and bland results. It is better I prompt to put Frasier in a new situation, like his favorite coffee shop Cafe Nervosa being taken over by hipsters (which yes, was pretty funny to read!) 

Let's do this example. The TV show Yellowstone (starring Kevin Costner as the patriarch of an eponymous ranch in Montana) been a massive hit in the United States. It has prompted a number of spinoffs like 1883 and 1923, which serve as origin stories of previous generations of the Dutton family managing the ranch. Wouldn't it be awesome if there was another spinoff called 2083, which takes place in the future and Keanu Reeves stars as the new patriarch in a cyberpunk western? Let's do it! 

**PROMPT:**

> The TV show Yellowstone has had spinoffs like 1883 and 1923. Write the premise for another spinoff called 2083, which will have a cyberpunk western setting starring Keanu Reeves as the new Dutton patriarch over the Yellowstone Ranch. The threats to his ranch include the synthetic meat industry lobbying to shut down the beef industry,  hired hackers trying to expose scandal in his family, and a hover bike accident involving his son.

**RESPONSE:**

>Sure, here is the premise for a cyberpunk western spinoff of Yellowstone called 2083, starring Keanu Reeves as the new Dutton patriarch:
>
>The year is 2083. The world is a very different place than it was just a few centuries ago. The synthetic meat industry has lobbied to shut down the beef industry, and the Yellowstone Ranch is one of the few remaining cattle ranches in the country.
>
>The Duttons are under threat from all sides. Hired hackers are trying to expose scandal in the family, and a hover bike accident involving the patriarch's son has left him in a coma.
>
>Keanu Reeves stars as the new Dutton patriarch, John Dutton IV. He is a hardened man who has seen it all, but he is determined to keep the Yellowstone Ranch alive and protect his family from their enemies.
>
>The synthetic meat industry is led by a ruthless CEO named Marcus Wheeler. He is determined to destroy the Yellowstone Ranch and replace it with a synthetic meat factory. He has hired a team of hackers to expose scandal in the Dutton family, and he has also financed a hover bike gang to terrorize the ranch.
>
>The Dutton family is also facing threats from within. John Dutton III, the patriarch's brother, is a greedy and ambitious man who is willing to do anything to get his hands on the Yellowstone Ranch. He has aligned himself with Marcus Wheeler, and he is plotting to overthrow John Dutton IV.
>
>John Dutton IV must use all of his skills and resources to keep the Yellowstone Ranch alive. He must face down the synthetic meat industry, the hover bike gang, and his own family. If he fails, the Yellowstone Ranch will be lost forever.
>
>Here are some additional details that could be explored in the show:
>
>* The conflict between the synthetic meat industry and the cattle industry could be explored in more depth. What are the ethical implications of synthetic meat? How does it affect the environment?
>* The hacker subplot could be used to explore the dark side of technology. How can hackers be used to manipulate and control people?
>* The hover bike gang could be used to explore the dangers of gang culture. How do gangs recruit and groom young people? What are the long-term effects of gang violence?
>
>I think this could be a really interesting show with a lot of potential. It would be a great way to explore the themes of family, loyalty, and the fight for survival in a dystopian future.
