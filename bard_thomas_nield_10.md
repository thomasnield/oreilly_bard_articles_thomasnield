## Use Bard to Write Fan Fiction, Spinoffs, and Sequels

When I started to use LLM's like Bard, some of the most fun I had was having it do "fan fiction." I have to call it that because I do not have any influence on my favorite characters in TV shows, movies, books, etc. But it was still fun to throw different plot ideas at these characters and see what Bard would generate. For example, Bard can create crossovers with different characters from different franchises, or create spinoffs and sequels. This certainly inspired some creativity and made me wish I worked in show business. If you are reading this and working in show business, I hope you find this topic I am about to cover helpful!

The key though, like any task, is to provide a prompt with specific guidance to do something original and interesting... rather than giving a generic prompt that will produce generic results. For example, if I ask it "Write another episode of the TV show Frasier," I am probably going to get predictable and bland results. It is better I prompt to put Frasier in a new situation, like his favorite coffee shop Cafe Nervosa being taken over by hipsters (which yes, was pretty funny to read!) 

Let's do this example. The TV show Yellowstone (starring Kevin Costner as the patriarch of an eponymous ranch in Montana) been a massive hit in the United States. It has prompted a number of spinoffs like 1883 and 1923, which serve as origin stories of previous generations of the Dutton family managing the ranch. Wouldn't it be awesome if there was another spinoff called 2083, which takes place in the future and Keanu Reeves stars as the new patriarch in a cyberpunk western? Let's do it! 

**PROMPT:**

> The TV show Yellowstone has had spinoffs like 1883 and 1923. Write the premise for another spinoff called 2083, which will have a cyberpunk western setting starring Keanu Reeves as the new Dutton patriarch over the Yellowstone Ranch. The threats to his ranch include the synthetic meat industry lobbying to shut down the beef industry,  hired hackers trying to expose scandal in his family, and a hover bike accident involving his son.

**RESPONSE:**

>Sure, here is the premise for a cyberpunk western spinoff of Yellowstone called 2083, starring Keanu Reeves as the new Dutton patriarch:
>
>The year is 2083. The world is a very different place than it was just a few centuries ago. The synthetic meat industry has lobbied to shut down the beef industry, and the Yellowstone Ranch is one of the few remaining cattle ranches in the country.
>
>The Duttons are under threat from all sides. Hired hackers are trying to expose scandal in the family, and a hover bike accident involving the patriarch's son has left him in a coma.
>
>Keanu Reeves stars as the new Dutton patriarch, John Dutton IV. He is a hardened man who has seen it all, but he is determined to keep the Yellowstone Ranch alive and protect his family from their enemies.
>
>The synthetic meat industry is led by a ruthless CEO named Marcus Wheeler. He is determined to destroy the Yellowstone Ranch and replace it with a synthetic meat factory. He has hired a team of hackers to expose scandal in the Dutton family, and he has also financed a hover bike gang to terrorize the ranch.
>
>The Dutton family is also facing threats from within. John Dutton III, the patriarch's brother, is a greedy and ambitious man who is willing to do anything to get his hands on the Yellowstone Ranch. He has aligned himself with Marcus Wheeler, and he is plotting to overthrow John Dutton IV.
>
>John Dutton IV must use all of his skills and resources to keep the Yellowstone Ranch alive. He must face down the synthetic meat industry, the hover bike gang, and his own family. If he fails, the Yellowstone Ranch will be lost forever.
>
>Here are some additional details that could be explored in the show:
>
>* The conflict between the synthetic meat industry and the cattle industry could be explored in more depth. What are the ethical implications of synthetic meat? How does it affect the environment?
>* The hacker subplot could be used to explore the dark side of technology. How can hackers be used to manipulate and control people?
>* The hover bike gang could be used to explore the dangers of gang culture. How do gangs recruit and groom young people? What are the long-term effects of gang violence?
>
>I think this could be a really interesting show with a lot of potential. It would be a great way to explore the themes of family, loyalty, and the fight for survival in a dystopian future.

Okay, this is great! There is a lot I need to unpack and disclose though. For one, I had previous prompts that were not giving me great results because of the very reason I stated earlier: uncreative inputs give uncreative results. Telling it to "Create a Cyberpunk western spinoff of the TV series Yellowtone called 2083" gave me little to work off of, and focused on formulaic cyberpunk plots. I found I got much, much better results when I gave it some details: cast Keanu Reeves and cite some specific conflicts that fit the themes of Yellowstone, but with some cyberpunk elements fused in. Lo and behold, we have something tangible and fun to work off of. 

All this guidance you have to provide might put readers into two camps: those who are disappointed the "AI" lacks originality and needs hand-holding, and those who are relieved they are not going to be replaced by AI anytime soon! To both groups, I say this: the AI did a great job fleshing out plots and creating characters when provided a rough but pointed framework to work off of. This is immensely valuable but yes, requires human guidance. This is more reason why AI is a tool, not a replacement, of human workers including the writing industry. 

This plot is pretty strong, and I think we got everything we need on that front to fill a whole season. When I start the writing process, I can consult Bard along the way when I hit writers' block. Let's say I need some guidance on the visual direction of the show. Let's ask Bard to provide some help. 

**PROMPT:**
> What are some visual qualities the show could use? Like what does the ranch look like? How are people dressed? What vehicles do people use? All of which should fuse cyberpunk with western.

**RESPONSE:**

>Sure, here are some visual qualities that the show could use to fuse cyberpunk with western:
>
>* The ranch could be a sprawling complex of buildings, fences, and corrals, with a mix of traditional western and futuristic elements. The buildings could be made of wood and stone, but they could also have features like solar panels and holographic displays.
>* The people could be dressed in a mix of western and cyberpunk clothing. They might wear cowboy hats and boots, but they might also wear leather jackets and goggles.
>* The vehicles could be a mix of traditional western vehicles like horses and wagons, and futuristic vehicles like hover bikes and flying cars.
>*Here are some specific examples of how these visual qualities could be used:
>
>* The ranch could be located in a remote desert valley, surrounded by mountains and mesas. The buildings could be made of adobe and stone, with solar panels on the roofs. The people could wear traditional cowboy clothing, but they might also wear leather jackets and goggles to protect themselves from the sun and dust. They might ride horses, but they might also use hover bikes to get around.
>* The ranch could be located in a city, surrounded by skyscrapers and neon lights. The buildings could be made of steel and glass, with holographic displays on the walls. The people could wear futuristic clothing, but they might also wear cowboy hats and boots to show their Western heritage. They might drive flying cars, but they might also ride horses to get around.
>* The specific visual qualities that the show uses will depend on the specific story that it is trying to tell. However, by fusing cyberpunk with western, the show can create a unique and visually stunning world that is both familiar and unfamiliar.

Prop master and costume designer, please get to work! We got a show to make. These visual styles are giving me different options to play with. Of course, I am not going to follow these directions verbatim and I will probably cherrypick what I like. Costume suggestions are great! Cowboy hats and AR goggles, as well as horses and hover bikes, are great fusions of two worlds. I like the idea of the ranch still being a ranch, but the holographics and solar panels add an unsettling vibe that change is creeping into the ranch. Maybe I can add some futuristic neon beacons to the surrounding mountains to guide aircraft into the downtown, where a sprawling cyberpunk urban scene has populated the valley. This creates an interesting dichotomy between past and future, rural and urban, and western versus scifi. 

See how the creative juices are just flowing now? And I am just firing on all pistons bringing this show to life? Bard helped take a few sentences and gave me something tangible, and then now all the creativity and details just start spawning left and right! 

Taylor Sheridan, if you happen to read this, hire me! I can write three seasons of this show easy!
