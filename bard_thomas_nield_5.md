## Use Bard to Rewrite Emails 

No matter what your job role is nowadays, from a car mechanic to a software engineer, almost everybody has to write emails. It has become one of our main modes of communication in conducting business.  However, putting things in email can sometimes be hard to get right. We may want to convey the right tone, or use the right choice of words to get the response we want. Rather than hemming and hawing, we can use Bard to expedite writing an email.

Let's say I am a brusque senior software developer always under a heavy workload and therefore a bit impatient. My manager tells me to be easier on the new guy they just hired. He's a fresh college grad with a data science background but is pivoting more into a software engineering role. The manager says there is some expected skill gap and to mentor him. 

Being overly busy with sprint deadlines, my first impulse would be to send a blunt and "to-the-point" email like this: 

>"Hey you just committed code to the production branch that was full of bugs, failed unit tests, and would have practically crashed our server. You have to do better than this!"

Of course, in person I could say this in a much calmer and gentler tone. But the thing about email is it does not convey tone well, and this could have been read as practically yelling. Not wanting to spend 15 minutes belaboring a diplomatically-worded email, I can turn to Bard for help. Let's ask it to rewrite our email in a more diplomatic tone. 

**PROMPT:**
>Rewrite this email to be more diplomatic: "Hey you just committed code to the production branch that was full of bugs, failed unit tests, and would have practically crashed our server. You have to do better than this!"


**RESPONSE:**

>
>Sure, here is the email rewritten to be more diplomatic:
>
>Dear [recipient name],
>
>I hope this email finds you well.
>
>I'm writing to you today because I noticed that you recently committed some code to the production branch that contained a number of bugs. The code also failed the unit tests, and it would have caused our server to crash if it had been deployed.
>
>I understand that mistakes happen, and I'm not trying to be critical. However, I do want to bring this to your attention so that we can avoid any future problems.
>
>I would be happy to help you review your code and identify any potential issues. I also recommend that you run the unit tests before you commit any code to the production branch.
>
>I'm confident that you can do better than this, and I'm here to help you in any way that I can.
>
>Thank you for your time,
>[Your name]
>
>Here are some tips for writing a diplomatic email:
>
>Use a respectful tone.
>Avoid using accusatory language.
>Focus on the problem, not the person.
>Offer to help the recipient resolve the issue.
>End the email on a positive note.
>I hope this helps!

This is pretty good! It not only rewrote the email in a more polite and solution-focused way, but it provided some helpful tips that might help my soft skills. I can take this as-is, or make manual tweaks to fit the voice and message I want to portray.

Conversely, let's say I have the opposite problem of needing to be more assertive. I am waiting on my coworker Carl to provide feedback on a contract renewal for a client. He said he would get to it a few times but now the deadline is looming. My typical message to him would be something like this: 

>"Hey how's it going, Carl? I was wondering, when you have the time and it is not an inconvenience, to provide your feedback on that contract renewal with the client. Thank you as always!"
>
Normally there is nothing wrong with framing requests this way, but if you are not getting results you may have to change your language. It can be exhausting for some people to take a crash-course on the art of negotiating and being more assertive, so let's just outsource that to Bard. 

**PROMPT:**

>Rewrite this email to be a little more assertive: "Hey how's it going, Carl? I was wondering, when you have the time and it is not an inconvenience, to provide your feedback on that contract renewal with the client. Thank you as always!" 

**RESPONSE:**

>Sure, here is the email rewritten to be more assertive:
>
>
>Hi Carl,
>
>I hope this email finds you well.
>
>I'm writing to you today because I need your feedback on the contract renewal with the client. I know you're busy, but I'm hoping you can take a look at it as soon as possible.
>
>The deadline for the renewal is coming up soon, and I need to make sure that we're all on the same page. I've already reviewed the contract, but I would really appreciate your input.
>
>I know you have a lot of experience with these types of contracts, so I'm hoping you can point out any potential issues or areas that need to be revised.
>
>I'm available to discuss the contract with you at your convenience. Please let me know when you have a few minutes to chat.
>
>Thank you for your time and consideration.
>
>Best,
>[Your name]
>
>
>Here are some tips for writing an assertive email:
>
>* Be clear and direct about what you want.
>* Use "I" statements to express your needs.
>* Avoid using passive voice or indirect language.
>* Be respectful, but firm.
>* End the email on a positive note.
>
>I hope this helps!

Okay, that is beautiful. It re-wrote the email in an assertive but polite way. It acknowledged the recipient's time and knowledge is valuable but communicates a sense of urgency and why. It also provided some great tips to being more assertive. As always review the output and tweak accordingly to fit your own voice, but this saved us time from belaboring to ourselves the best way to write an assertive email. 

Now you can focus more on your actual job, and save time writing effective communications with Bard. A good template is to provide a quick draft of an email with what you want to say, and then tell Bard to rewrite it with the qualities you want.
