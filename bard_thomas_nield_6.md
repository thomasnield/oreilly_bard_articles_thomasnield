## Use Bard to Merge Ideas and Create Satire 

If there is one thing that LLM's like Bard (usually) do well, it is taking two ideas and merging them together into something amusing. Satire is a good application for this, but to use Bard it helps to have an original thought on what two ideas to merge. After that though, you can get some surprisingly good results that can further spark your creativity. 

Let's think of a critical and yet boring topic... oh, I know! How about monetary policy? Given the headlines about [Jerome Powell, inflation interest rates, the effect on jobs and markets, and wealth inequality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw) this is something people should talk about more. How do we do that? What is something fun and over-the-top that contradicts something dry and boring? 

Well, I think the answer is obvious: take the issue of monetary policy and present it as a 90's style toy action figure commercial! Let's prompt Bard to do just that. Note, I have found that if you intend the output to be funny then make sure you communicate that in your prompt too. 

**PROMPT:**

> Script a funny 90s style kids toy commercial for a Jerome Powell action figure.

**RESPONSE:**

>Sure, here is a funny 90s style kids toy commercial for a Jerome Powell action figure:
>
>Scene 1:
>A group of kids are playing in a living room. They are all dressed up in suits and ties, and they are sitting around a table, pretending to be at a meeting.
>
>Kid 1: I'm Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. I'm here to talk about the economy.
>
>Kid 2: The economy? That's boring!
>
>Kid 3: Yeah, let's play with our action figures instead.
>
>Kid 1: But I'm not just any action figure. I'm the Jerome Powell action figure!
>
>Kid 2: What can you do?
>
>Kid 1: I can raise interest rates, lower interest rates, and print money.
>
>Kid 3: That's awesome! Let's play!
>
>Scene 2:
>
>The kids are now playing with their Jerome Powell action figures. They are raising interest rates, lowering interest rates, and printing money.
>
>Kid 1: I'm raising interest rates!
>
>Kid 2: I'm lowering interest rates!
>
>Kid 3: I'm printing money!
>
>Scene 3:
>
>The kids are now having a wild party. They are dancing, drinking, and having a great time.
>
>Kid 1: This is the best party ever!
>
>Kid 2: Thanks to Jerome Powell!
>
>Kid 3: He's the best action figure ever!
>
>Narrator: The Jerome Powell action figure. He's the one who makes the economy go round. Get yours today!
>

Okay, if you are nerd like me on these kinds of issues, you are probably rolling on the floor at the first two scenes. The third scene however is a little awkward. Granted, I can explain the reason the kids are partying is because when the Fed lowers interest rates and makes free money, it essentially causes the markets and Wall Street to party. It is when interest rates are raised that the proverbial "punch bowl" is taken away because things get too out of hand. So Bard pulled some valid source material for creating this scene. However, I think Bard failed to infer that kids partying and drinking is a little innappropriate. 

Regardless, we can remedy this with some further prompting. Let's also introduce a villain for Jerome Powell called Wall Street Man, who has a special power called [Taper Tantrum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp). 

**PROMPT:**

>Remove the party scene, make Wall Street Man Jeromeâ€™s nemesis, and Wall Street Man has a superpower called Taper Tantrum.

**RESPONSE:**

>Sure, here is the revised commercial with Wall Street Man as Jerome's nemesis and a superpower called Taper Tantrum:
>
>Scene 1:
>
>A group of kids are playing in a living room. They are all dressed up in suits and ties, and they are sitting around a table, pretending to be at a meeting.
>
>Kid 1: I'm Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. I'm here to talk about the economy.

>Kid 2: The economy? That's boring!

>Kid 3: Yeah, let's play with our action figures instead.

>Kid 1: But I'm not just any action figure. I'm the Jerome Powell action figure!

>Kid 2: What can you do?

>Kid 1: I can raise interest rates, lower interest rates, and print money.
>
>Kid 3: That's awesome! Let's play!

>Scene 2:
>The kids are now playing with their Jerome Powell action figures. They are raising interest rates, lowering interest rates, and printing money.
>
>Kid 1: I'm raising interest rates!
>
>Kid 2: I'm lowering interest rates!
>
>Kid 3: I'm printing money!
>
>Wall Street Man: Not so fast, Jerome! I'm Wall Street Man, and I have a superpower called Taper Tantrum!
>
>Kid 1: Taper Tantrum? What's that?
>
>Wall Street Man: It's a superpower that makes the stock market crash!
>
>Kid 1: Oh no!
>
>Wall Street Man: That's right, Jerome. I'm going to make the stock market crash, and there's nothing you can do to stop me!
>
>Kid 1: We'll see about that!
>
>Scene 3:
>
>Jerome Powell and Wall Street Man are now facing off in a battle of wits. Jerome Powell is trying to raise interest rates to calm the markets, but Wall Street Man is using his Taper Tantrum superpower to make the stock market crash.
>
>Jerome Powell: I'm raising interest rates!
>
>Wall Street Man: Taper Tantrum!
>
>Jerome Powell: I'm raising interest rates again!
>
>Wall Street Man: Taper Tantrum!
>
>The battle continues, with Jerome Powell and Wall Street Man using their powers to try to outdo each other. In the end, Jerome Powell is victorious, and Wall Street Man is defeated.
>
>Narrator: The Jerome Powell action figure. He's the one who makes the economy go round. Get yours today!

Okay, the third scene is much better. The visual of three kids playing with Jerome Powell and Wall Street Man action figures, and puppeting them in a battle of interest rates and taper tantrums is just comedic perfection. Massage this script a bit, get a small production budget, and you will have some high-quality YouTube or late-night content right here. 

To emphasize again, LLM's like Bard can do quite well merging two ideas together. If you take two things that normally do not go together (e.g. monetary policy and 90's toy commercials) you can create pretty original content. Even more, it can be an effective tool for exploring ideas and seeing if there is potential to lean into them more. To prevent bland and cliche outputs, do not be afraid to nudge the model with specific prompts and ideas (e.g. Wall Street Man having the "Taper Tantrum" superpower). Also, know when to continue iterating the model versus taking over manually and build on the material you have.
