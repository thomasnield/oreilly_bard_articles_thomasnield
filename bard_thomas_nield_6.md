## Use Bard for Comedic Satire 

If there is one thing that LLM's like Bard (usually) do well, it is taking two ideas and merging them together into something amusing. Satire is a good application for this, but to use Bard it helps to have an original thought on what two ideas to merge. After that though, you can get some surprisingly good results that can further spark your creativity. 

Let's think of a critical and yet boring topic... oh, I know! How about monetary policy? Given the headlines about Jerome Powell, interest rates, the effect on jobs and markets, [as well as being a causal factor for wealth inequality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw) this is something people should talk about more. How do we do that? What is something fun and over-the-top that contradicts something dry and boring? 

Well, I think the answer is obvious: take the issue of monetary policy and present it as a 90's style toy action figure commercial! Let's prompt Bard to do just that. Note, I have found that if you intend the output to be funny then make sure you communicate that in your prompt too. 

**PROMPT:**

> Script a funny 90s style kids toy commercial for a Jerome Powell action figure.

**RESPONSE:**

>Sure, here is a funny 90s style kids toy commercial for a Jerome Powell action figure:
>
>Scene 1:
>A group of kids are playing in a living room. They are all dressed up in suits and ties, and they are sitting around a table, pretending to be at a meeting.
>
>Kid 1: I'm Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. I'm here to talk about the economy.
>
>Kid 2: The economy? That's boring!
>
>Kid 3: Yeah, let's play with our action figures instead.
>
>Kid 1: But I'm not just any action figure. I'm the Jerome Powell action figure!
>
>Kid 2: What can you do?
>
>Kid 1: I can raise interest rates, lower interest rates, and print money.
>
>Kid 3: That's awesome! Let's play!
>
>Scene 2:
>
>The kids are now playing with their Jerome Powell action figures. They are raising interest rates, lowering interest rates, and printing money.
>
>Kid 1: I'm raising interest rates!
>
>Kid 2: I'm lowering interest rates!
>
>Kid 3: I'm printing money!
>

Okay, if you are nerd like me on these kinds of issues, you are probably rolling on the floor at the first two secenes. The third scene however is a little awkward. Granted, I can explain the reason the kids are partying is because when the Fed lowers interest rates and makes free money, it essentially causes the markets to "party." It is when interest rates are raised that the proverbial "punch bowl" is taken away because things get too out of hand. So Bard had some valid inspiration for creating this scene. However, I think Bard failed to infer that kids partying and drinking is a little innappropriate. Let's just hope it's root beer!

Regardless, we can remedy this with some further prompting. Let's also introduce a villain for Jerome Powell called Wall Street Man, who has a special power called [Taper Tantrum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp). 

**PROMPT:**

>Remove the party scene, make Wall Street Man Jeromeâ€™s nemesis, and Wall Street Man has a superpower called Taper Tantrum.

**RESPONSE:**

>Sure, here is the revised commercial with Wall Street Man as Jerome's nemesis and a superpower called Taper Tantrum:
