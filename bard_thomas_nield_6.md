## Use Bard for Comedic Satire 

If there is one thing that LLM's like Bard (usually) do well, it is taking two ideas and merging them together into something amusing. Satire is a good application for this, but to use Bard it helps to have an original thought on what two ideas to merge. After that though, you can get some surprisingly good results that can further spark your creativity. 

Let's think of a critical and yet boring topic... how about monetary policy? Given the headlines about Jerome Powell, interest rates, the effect on jobs and markets, [as well as wealth inequality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMLAQbSYAw) this is something people should talk about more. How do we do that? Well, take the issue and present it as a 90's style toy action figure commercial! Let's prompt Bard to do just that. Also, I have found that if you intend the output to be comedic then make sure you make that part of your prompt too.

Okay, if you are nerd like me on these kinds of issues, you are probably rolling on the floor at the first two secenes. The third scene however is a little awkward. Granted, I can explain the reason the kids are partying is because when the Fed lowers interest rates, it essentially causes the markets to "party". It is when interest rates are raised that the proverbial "punch bowl" is taken away because things get too out of hand. 

Remove the party scene, make Wall Street man Jeromeâ€™s nemesis, and Wall Street Man has a superpower called Taper Tantrum   

Sure, here is the revised commercial with Wall Street Man as Jerome's nemesis and a superpower called Taper Tantrum:
Scene 1:
A group of kids are playing in a living room. They are all dressed up in suits and ties, and they are sitting around a table, pretending to be at a meeting.
Kid 1: I'm Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. I'm here to talk about the economy.
Kid 2: The economy? That's boring!
Kid 3: Yeah, let's play with our action figures instead.
Kid 1: But I'm not just any action figure. I'm the Jerome Powell action figure!
Kid 2: What can you do?
Kid 1: I can raise interest rates, lower interest rates, and print money.
Kid 3: That's awesome! Let's play!
Scene 2:
The kids are now playing with their Jerome Powell action figures. They are raising interest rates, lowering interest rates, and printing money.
Kid 1: I'm raising interest rates!
Kid 2: I'm lowering interest rates!
Kid 3: I'm printing money!
Wall Street Man: Not so fast, Jerome! I'm Wall Street Man, and I have a superpower called Taper Tantrum!
Kid 1: Taper Tantrum? What's that?
Wall Street Man: It's a superpower that makes the stock market crash!
Kid 1: Oh no!
Wall Street Man: That's right, Jerome. I'm going to make the stock market crash, and there's nothing you can do to stop me!
Kid 1: We'll see about that!
Scene 3:
Jerome Powell and Wall Street Man are now facing off in a battle of wits. Jerome Powell is trying to raise interest rates to calm the markets, but Wall Street Man is using his Taper Tantrum superpower to make the stock market crash.
Jerome Powell: I'm raising interest rates!
Wall Street Man: Taper Tantrum!
Jerome Powell: I'm raising interest rates again!
Wall Street Man: Taper Tantrum!
The battle continues, with Jerome Powell and Wall Street Man using their powers to try to outdo each other. In the end, Jerome Powell is victorious, and Wall Street Man is defeated.
