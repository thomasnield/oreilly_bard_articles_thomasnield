## Use Bard to Create Math LaTex 

One of the more esoteric declarative languages out there is [LaTex for mathematics](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics). It allows creating and formatting mathematical expressions for documents, books, and other publications. Increasingly it has found usage outside the halls of academia, especially since it is now supported on [Github markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions) and Jupyter notebooks. As more people become involved in machine learning and data science, math LaTex becomes increasingly useful to larger groups. 

However, Math LaTex has a [bit of a learning curve](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions) and you may only have so much time to learn so many things. Thankfully, we can try to describe to Bard what we want to express mathematically.
